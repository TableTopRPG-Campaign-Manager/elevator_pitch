I propose a fullstack application that allows Game Masters to automate state management for their tabletop Role Playing Games. As a GM myself, I know there are a LOT a moving pieces that often get left to the wayside in the interest of moving the game forward. This application would give the GM a place to store lore and notes in a wikilike structure as well as give them the tools to build encounters and manage game state within those encounters. Players would be provided with an interface alot like a digital character sheet, that also displays information about the current encounter, time of day, weather, location descriptions, and character descriptions. From the GMs interface they can  prompt players for actions and inputs, Maintain minor sets of state, and provide descriptions in an easy to retrieve way that will help GM's, expecially new ones, run a fast paced and smooth game experience.

# New Technology
Chakra, Material UI, and or bootStrap for Styling
React DnD or paralax for interactive UI
Websocket, signalR, or socket.io for realtime services
I intend to work through each of these and come to a conclusion as to which I will use at a later date.
